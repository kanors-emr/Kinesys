Introduction

KiNESYS+ (**Knowledge based Investigation of Energy system Scenarios**) is a bottom-up, technology rich, least-cost optimization, multi-regional global energy system model,
which is developed using the TIMES model generator of IEA-ETSAP.

Energy system models need to be built faster and better
    The need for energy system modeling is increasing due to rapid transitions in the energy sector. Understanding cross-sector interactions is crucial for driving system change.
    There's a need to address urgent short-term issues within a long-term context, considering multiple intersecting uncertainties. To tackle these challenges, the ability to envision,
    explore, and communicate disruptive scenarios is crucial.

    The flexible and feature-rich TIMES modeling framework is suitable to build energy system models, but it takes a considerable amount of time to build, demands substantial effort
    for enhancements and updates. Additionally, TIMES models are practically inaccessible
    to those outside the TIMES modeling circle. In a nutshell, to be an effective user, one MUST become a "TIMES expert" first.

    There's a need for a *nimble modeling* approach in addressing energy-related questions, especially those with a global scope and varying regional/technological focuses.
    Whether it's exploring global hydrogen scenarios, understanding LNG supply, demand, and trade, or ensuring energy security in specific regions,
    a one-size-fits-all model with static regional and temporal aggregation is not the best option.

Need to widen the engagement with models - beyond the core modeling team

    Wider Engagement Brings Diverse Perspectives:

        * Cross-Disciplinary Insights: When diverse experts engage with model results, they bring unique perspectives that can lead to more comprehensive insights. For example, a power systems expert or a national energy planner might identify anomalies that the core modeling team overlooked, offering valuable insights for the policy makers.
        * Innovative Problem-Solving: Diverse perspectives often lead to more creative and effective solutions. Different stakeholders might ask varied questions or spot additional trends.
        * Enhanced Understanding and Buy-In: When stakeholders are directly involved in analyzing and interpreting data, they're likely to have a deeper understanding of the results. This can lead to greater acceptance and support for data-driven decisions.

    Stakeholders Using Insights More Efficiently:

        * Direct Engagement with Models: Allowing stakeholders to interact with models directly can significantly shorten the decision-making process. Instead of waiting for analyses from the core team, they can query the model and get insights relevant to their specific concerns.
        * Tailored Insights for Specific Needs: Different stakeholders might have varied informational needs. Direct access to models allows them to extract the specific data points that are most relevant to their tasks or decisions.

The KiNESYS methodology introduces a transformative solution to the two challenges outlined above - their complexity and the difficulty in accessibility for non-specialists.
This approach is designed to make energy system modeling more intuitive, flexible, and open, thereby enhancing its utility for policy formulation and energy research.

Development of the KiNESYS Framework

    * **Granular Data for Comprehensive Analysis**: At its core, KiNESYS utilizes a relational database to store data at the finest granularity, such as energy balances on a national or regional level, specific details of energy supply infrastructure, and hourly profiles for electricity demand and renewable energy resources. This granular approach ensures that models accurately reflect the intricacies of real-world energy systems, providing a solid foundation for policy and research analysis.

    * **Dynamic Model Configuration**: Through advanced data aggregation and disaggregation capabilities, KiNESYS allows for the creation of model instances tailored to specific analytical needs. Whether it's exploring regional energy strategies or assessing the impact of new technologies, KiNESYS delivers the flexibility to customize models according to various scenarios and scales.

    * **Efficient Model Adaptation**: Leveraging a knowledge database, KiNESYS enables the swift development of multiple model instances, facilitating rapid exploration of different temporal, spatial, and technological considerations without redundant setup efforts. This efficiency is crucial for timely and informed policy decision-making and research.

    * **Enhanced Model Foundation**: Building on the robust TIAM global model, KiNESYS integrates proven modeling techniques with innovative approaches to data management and analysis. This combination ensures that users benefit from a rich legacy of modeling expertise while accessing cutting-edge functionalities.

    * **Flexibility and Accessibility**: With features like flexible aggregation and the provision of country-specific "starter" models, KiNESYS significantly lowers the barriers to model development and customization, making sophisticated energy system analysis more accessible to policymakers and researchers alike.

VO provides an interactive online platform that enables direct access to model inputs and outputs, facilitating real-time analysis and collaboration. This online accessibility ensures that complex models are within reach of a wider audience, empowering policymakers and researchers with the tools needed for detailed energy system analysis.

Engaging Process for Continuous Improvement

    * **Verification and Calibration**: KiNESYS prioritizes confidence in model outcomes through rigorous calibration checks and comparisons with external benchmarks. This process ensures the reliability of model predictions, serving as a dependable basis for policy development and academic research.

    * **Comprehensive Scenario Exploration**: The approach encourages a thorough investigation of diverse scenarios, focusing on the dynamics of fuel and technology transitions under various abatement strategies. Such in-depth analysis aids in identifying effective policy measures and research opportunities.

    * **Collaborative Stakeholder Engagement**: KiNESYS emphasizes the importance of stakeholder involvement in refining models and shaping policy scenarios. This collaborative effort ensures that the modeling process remains relevant and aligned with current and future energy challenges, enhancing the impact of research and policy interventions.

In essence, the KiNESYS approach democratizes energy system modeling for policymakers and energy researchers, offering a powerful tool for exploring complex energy dynamics and informing strategic decisions. Through its innovative framework, KiNESYS facilitates a deeper understanding of energy systems, empowering stakeholders to craft policies and research agendas that effectively address the challenges and opportunities of sustainable energy transitions.
